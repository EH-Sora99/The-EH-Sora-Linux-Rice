# The-EH-Sora-Linux-Rice
This is a repository of my Linux Rice
Update as I go

Due to figure out how to translate a Arch based system/Hyprland setup (using Diinki's video as base and how to use parts of the HyDE project)

And due to having no clue what I'm doing and figure out how to jump from Arch (EndeavorOS) to Fedora Linux.

I don't need everything or completly understand how HyDE works

What the goals are for this?
* The bere minimum Hyprland
* how to build a script to insall everything and setting everything up for Hyprland
* Build a key-bindings list (A desktop wiget that updates when the config is updated)

Based on this Diinki YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFz5gLqv-FM
